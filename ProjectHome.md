The version of Ringdroid on the Market now requires Android 1.6! If you have Android 1.5 and can't find Ringdroid on the Market, download [Ringdroid 2.3](http://ringdroid.googlecode.com/files/Ringdroid-2.3.apk), which will work great on your phone.

**16 July 2009: Ringdroid 2.0 adds AAC support (iTunes music files), lets you assign ringtones directly to a contact, and includes more descriptive error messages when something goes wrong.**

**26 April 2009: Ringdroid 1.1 adds compatibility with Android 1.5 (Cupcake) and phones with a soft keyboard, and makes it possible to delete sounds from within Ringdroid by long-pressing on a sound in the main list view.**

Ringdroid is an [Android](http://code.google.com/android/) application for recording and editing sounds, and creating ringtones, directly on the handset.
